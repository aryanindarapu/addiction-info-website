# Addiction Treatment Map

A website with extensive information on treatment for drug and alcohol addicts and their families. The website includes a map of treatment centers for each type of addiction, and will also give users the option to rate a treatment center, giving others a better understanding of what works and what doesn't. There is also information about which treatments are more effective for each type of addiction.
